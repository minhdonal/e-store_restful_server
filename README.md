-- connect mysql with python/Flask --
pip install mysql-connector-python
link: https://pynative.com/install-mysql-connector-python/

(!) Question:
Why we don't use the built-in Flask-MySQL like below, and using
very connectDB.py class?

`pip install flask-mysql`
`from flask.ext.mysql import MySQL`
https://flask-mysql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

-- flask --
Install Flask py -3 -m venv venv 
pip install Flask 
pip install -U flask-cors

--start--
cmd-> python main.py
-> this page will start with localhost:5000
